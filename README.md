So, this is it.

SSD1327 based 128x128 OLED display may the best choice i have ever made.
</p>

<p align="center">
It has good refresh rate, low power consumption and adjustable contrast.

This will be the best place to develop compatible display driver for my new project "NINJAR".

    Heya, I'm developing linux drivers for E-paper display recently.
</span>

</br>

<span>
    When I was developing fb driver for st7789v, there some problem with
    spi signal caused device received wrong color data.
</span>

</br>

<span>
    The fb driver for ssd1306 isn't a real grayscale format, i mean it's convert from rgb565, learn nothing. so keep develop grayscale driver.

This project is based on fbtft
